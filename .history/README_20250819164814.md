# NK_datasets

NK_datasets ships standardized datasets for **NPB** (Nippon Professional Baseball) and **KBO** (Korea Baseball Organization), packaged with pandas loaders.  
It also includes MLB players who have played in either NPB, KBO, or both.

- MLB players are aligned with the [Lahman Database](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/).
- KBO data was scraped from the official [KBO website](https://www.koreabaseball.com/).
- NPB data was scraped from the official [NPB website](https://npb.jp/eng/) and [npbstats.com](http://npbstats.com/eng/).
